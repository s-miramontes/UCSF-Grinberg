# How do I save my Files?

To ensure a healthy software environment for Grinberg's lab, we must stay organized!
For every image that you scan, there are two steps you need to follow. 

1. Generate a copy of the scanned/finalized .tif images and save it in the general `To_Count` folder.
2. Generate a second copy of the scanned/finalized .tif images and save it in your personal gDrive "To_Count" folder.

**IMPORTANT: BEFORE PROCEEDING MAKE SURE YOU READ `FileProtocol.md` AND SPECIFICIALLY THE `How to Crop` SECTION.**

## What to do with Crops?

1. In your personal Folder
	A suggestion is to create subfolders per region. Say the region is `P2590_ROI1`, thus the specimen name is `P2590`. Then you can:
	- Create a sub-directory (in your personal directory) titled `P2590`
		- Once in this directory store each of the generated regions. For example, say there are a total of 5 regions you cropped. Then you sill save a total of 6 images (including the entire region).
			- `...P2590_ROI1...tif` 
			- `...P2590_ROI2...tif`
			- `...P2590_ROI3...tif`
			- `...P2590_ROI4...tif`
			- `...P2590_ROI5...tif`
			- `...P2590...tif` (this is the original, not cropped region.)

			*Note that the `...` denotes the other elements that should be included in your file name. See `FileProtocol.md`.*

2. In the general (Grinberg's lab) folder `To_Count`:
	All generated regions should be saved without needed order but **following the filename protocols**. See `FileProtocol.md`.
	- If you generated 5 cropped regions (following appropriate protocols), you need to include 5 copies in this general folder.
			- `...P2590_ROI1...tif` 
			- `...P2590_ROI2...tif`
			- `...P2590_ROI3...tif`
			- `...P2590_ROI4...tif`
			- `...P2590_ROI5...tif`

			*Note that the `...` denotes the other elements that should be included in your file name. See `FileProtocol.md`.*
